# 📁 My_First_Folder

**Project Codename:** `<ok.dope.>` × `Modified Prospect`  
**Purpose:** Create a real-world modular codebase that blends creativity, code, and memory — built step-by-step by someone *learning out loud*, so others can grow with us.

---

## ✨ WHY THIS EXISTS

This is more than a folder.  
It’s a **chapter**. A **memory**. A **promise** to stay intentional, modular, poetic, and persistent.

We believe:

- You can build from scratch without knowing everything.
- Every folder is a step toward **self-expression through structure**.
- Coding is not just technical — it's *Poetry_In_Coding(period)*.

## 🪜 FIRST STEPS (Beginner-Friendly Setup)

### ✅ Step 0 — What You Need
Before we begin, install:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) – our base runtime
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) – to track changes and version your growth
- A text editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

---

### ✅ Step 1 — Create the Folder

In your terminal:

```bash
mkdir my_first_folder
cd my_first_folder
npm init -y   # Initializes package.json
git init      # Starts version control
